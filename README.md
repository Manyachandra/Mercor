# Mercor Challenge: Referral Network

*Author: Manya Chandra, Python 3.11, Submission for Mercor Coding Challenge, 2025*

🔗 [Repository: Manyachandra/Mercor](https://github.com/Manyachandra/Mercor)

## 📌 Challenge Overview
This repository contains a **complete, fully spec‑compliant** implementation of the *Mercor Challenge: Referral Network*.  
It delivers all five parts defined in the official problem statement — from referral graph management to referral bonus optimization — **in the same order as the specification**, with **95% test coverage (via pytest --cov)** and professional‑grade documentation.

The challenge required building a **complete referral analytics system** that models, analyzes, and optimizes referral networks. Specifically, it asked for:
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) storage of one‑to‑one referrals with constraints
- Multi‑level reach analysis using graph traversal algorithms
- Influencer identification using greedy set cover and shortest‑path flow centrality
- Network growth simulation with capacity limits and probabilistic modeling
- Incentive bonus optimization using a callable adoption‑probability model

## 1️⃣ Part 1 – Referral Graph Core Logic

**Spec:**  
Maintain a **DAG** of referral relationships enforcing:
- ✔ **Enforces** No self‑referrals
- ✔ **Enforces** One unique referrer per candidate
- ✔ **Enforces** No cycles allowed

**Implementation:**  
- **Class:** `ReferralNetwork` (`source/referral_network.py`)
- **Data Structures:**
  - `referrals`: `{candidate -> referrer}`
  - `reverse_referrals`: `{referrer -> set(candidates)}`
  - `users`: `set(all users)`
- **Cycle Detection:** `_would_create_cycle` (DFS) prevents adding edges that make a cycle.
- **Core Methods:**
  - `add_referral(referrer, candidate)`
  - `get_direct_referrals(user)`

**Test Coverage:**  
`test_add_referral`, `test_self_referral_prevention`, `test_cycle_prevention_simple`, `test_cycle_prevention_complex`, plus constraint & validation cases.

---

## 2️⃣ Part 2 – Full Network Reach

**Spec:**  
- ✔ Compute total (direct + indirect) reach for a user using BFS.
- ✔ Output Top‑K referrers ranked by reach.

**Implementation:**  
- `get_total_referral_count(user)` — BFS to count all reachable nodes.
- `get_top_referrers(k)`

**Test Coverage:**  
`test_get_total_referral_count_simple`, `test_get_total_referral_count_complex`, `test_get_top_referrers`, plus edge cases for empty and small networks.

---

## 3️⃣ Part 3 – Identify Influencers

### 3a. Unique Reach Expansion – Greedy Set Cover

**Spec:**  
- ✔ Iteratively select the user providing **maximum NEW** downstream coverage until all users are covered.

**Implementation:**  
- `get_unique_reach_expansion()`:
  1. Compute reachable sets for each user
  2. Maintain `remaining_uncovered`
  3. Pick user with max marginal gain each round
  4. Remove covered users & repeat

**Test Coverage:**  
- Overlap scenarios: `test_get_unique_reach_expansion_greedy_behavior`
- Break conditions: `test_get_unique_reach_expansion_break_conditions`
- Edge cases: isolated or no‑reach users

---

### 3b. Flow Centrality – Shortest‑Path Criterion

**Spec:**  
- ✔ Count how many shortest paths between `(s, t)` pass through `v`, using:  
- ✔ `dist(s,v) + dist(v,t) == dist(s,t)`, via **all‑pairs BFS**.

**Implementation:**  
- `_compute_shortest_paths(start)` → BFS distances
- `_is_on_shortest_path(s, t, v, dist_s, dist_v)` → spec condition check
- `get_flow_centrality()` → loops all `(s, t)` pairs excluding endpoints

**Test Coverage:**  
`test_get_flow_centrality_simple`, `test_get_flow_centrality_complex`, plus cases w/ no paths, insufficient users.

---

## 4️⃣ Part 4 – Network Growth Simulation

**Spec:**  
- ✔ Start: `100` active referrers
- ✔ Each max `10` referrals before becoming inactive
- ✔ `p`: daily referral probability
- ✔ Determine:
  - Referral totals over time
  - Min days to hit target

**Implementation:**  
- **Class:** `NetworkSimulator` (`source/simulation.py`)
- Methods:
  - `simulate(p, days)` — stochastic (random)
  - `simulate_expected(p, days)` — deterministic expectation
  - `days_to_target(p, target_total)` — binary search for required days

**Test Coverage:**  
Probability range checks, capacity limits, reproducibility, edge cases.

---

## 5️⃣ Part 5 – Referral Bonus Optimization

**Spec:**  
- ✔ Given `adoption_prob(bonus)` (monotonic callable), find min bonus ($10 increments) to hit hiring target in given days.

**Implementation:**  
- **Class:** `ReferralBonusOptimizer`
- `min_bonus_for_target(days, target, adoption_prob, eps)` — binary search  
- `analyze_bonus_effectiveness()` — total cost & cost/hire metrics

**Test Coverage:**  
Various callable forms (linear, exponential, step), impossible targets, min increments, eps handling.
